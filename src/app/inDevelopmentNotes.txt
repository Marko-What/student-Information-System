/* functionality responsible for fecthing the students  data either to backend api in our case 	just json object does exist inside single route specific context students overview 

				as we are developing frontend application simulating functionality without api service on back fecthing the data from json and storing it inside a variable which later manipulated like adding new student item in an array, delete student item from the array or remodifty existing functionality

				persistance layer in an angular application / interacting with it should exist inside services 				services interfaces polymorphism, should serve as as an api to bussines part on an application where the application logic definitions are should easily interact with injected services interfaces 
	
				all the functionality interacting with mentioned above json fecth student data variable placeholder is minulated throughout service interface

				cause of fecthing the data using subscribers technique mimicing oberver design pattern where subscribers gets response after particular function call or event happening.

			still does exist inside comonent context definitions particular functionality is missing here
			the connection between services and httpclient angular module does not work inside services layer but does inside component context definitions
					in particular major application structure does holds two namespace context areas 
					app.module
				and lazy.module
		lazt module serve the application an with an interface behind angular route specific compnents which are lazily loaded after requesto to a resource is executed so there is no need to invoke unneccessary instances of components
		behind the route

    after successfuly installed npm latest version and npm install dependencies in development notes files suddenly closed down. So those are gone. Think of it rather save trackable notes about development backed/to save up mode.

    other issues solving


    trying to delete or somehow edit interact with users api does not work

    
            route
        /lazy/studentoverview
            corresponding controller

    
            variable declaration 
                still without typescript feature ecma script 6 support
                            those are not working outof the box installation 
                            check out also browser support about
                                    cdn babel in between otherwise 
                                        transpailing or if older browser
                                                translate script to ecma 5 is in place
                                        much work needs to be done that way
                    think of it 
                    bootstrap application at first and later on based on application need implementing functionality
